Yesterday marked the end of my third week working at papa Johns. Though it's only part time, I've been spacing out more often and losing my spirit when I'm not working. I can only assume that it's because I use much of my energy at work and unconsciously avoid exerting myself outside of work. This happened in the past when I worked at the bakery, only to a much greater extent due to it being a full time job. Of course, none of this is ideal. There are things I need to do and things I want to do. My life is not Papa Johns or any other job I may work at. Focus; It is my imperative to prepare myself because the situation can change any day and there aren't anymore chances to become a NEET. Failing this time means I'll have to go into the Dark. Or at least strongly consider it.
