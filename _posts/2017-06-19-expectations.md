There are basic things that I expect from others and it's nice if they live up to them, but also pretty amusing if they fail. These expectations are never voiced and always kept to myself. It leaves me wondering if they would do better if they knew I had expectations of them. Personally, if someone told me they expected my downfall, then I would try my hardest to rise above any obstacle ahead of me. If they expect me to be victorious, then it could that little boost of morale that saves me in the midst of defeat. Though losing in that situation would be pretty depressing.
